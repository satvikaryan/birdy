# Birdy

Birdy is a Python package designed for processing audio signals, particularly for the purpose of analyzing bird calls. It leverages the LibROSA library to process audio signals and extract relevant features. Birdy specializes in transforming audio signals into logarithmic Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms, which are commonly used in audio analysis tasks.

## Features

- **Audio Signal Processing**: Birdy utilizes LibROSA, a powerful Python library for audio and music analysis, to process raw audio signals.
- **Logarithmic STFT Spectrograms**: Birdy transforms audio signals into logarithmic Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms, providing a frequency representation of the audio over time.
- **Bird Call Detection**: Birdy integrates machine learning models to detect specific bird calls within the processed spectrograms.
- **Morse Code Encryption**: Birdy is capable of encoding detected bird calls into Morse code for transmission or further processing.
- **Currently Under Development**
